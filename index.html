        <p>Favorite culture that I'm not a part of: Japanese culture. I admire its art, technology, and the concept of harmony in design.</p>
        <p>Historical Figures that I relate to: Leonardo da Vinci for his creativity and curiosity, and Steve Jobs for his innovation and design thinking.</p>
        <p>A meal that represents me: Sushi, for its balance of flavors and emphasis on fresh, high-quality ingredients.</p>
        <p>I feel most creative when I am working on a challenging project that allows me to think outside the box and explore new ideas.</p>
